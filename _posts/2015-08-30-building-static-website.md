As described in [Previous Post](http://www.mbaharsyah.xyz/general/2015/08/27/new-website/), I built this website using Jekyll, hosted on Github Pages and use domain name registered from namecheap. This is how it was done.

## Github Pages

I used my existing Github [account](https://github.com/mbaharsyah) and created a new [User Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#user--organization-pages). Initially I only created a repository "[```mbaharsyah.github.io```](https://github.com/mbaharsyah/mbaharsyah.github.io)" and added an ```index.html``` file using Github's web interface with "Hello, World!" text.

Then I verified that everything was working properly by browsing to https://mbaharsyah.github.io/. Saw my "Hello, World!", and the ```index.html``` served its purpose. So I deleted the file and the repository to prepare for the real action.
