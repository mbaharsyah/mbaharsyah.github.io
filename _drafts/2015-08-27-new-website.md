I had wanted to setup my own website for so long. The main reason was simply to make myself visible on the net. Other benefits include:
* Platform for blogging about this and that
* Showcase my works (I am a software engineer, btw)
* Share my knowledge on the stuff I like
* ...

I had been looking for some alternatives when I found [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). Github pages can host [static pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page). And for me that's enough as I would not need a web application. While reading its description, I noticed one very interesting feature: blog with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)

I thought, what was this Jekyll thing, but it had me at "Markdown". I had been writing notes using [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for sometimes, and it had been helpful to keep focus on content rather than styles. The more I read about Jekyll, the more interesting it was. A lot of customizable templates available, easy to setup, what more could I ask for? 

However, the next feature was as interesting, [custom domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name)! I could use my own domain for github pages for free! ![2015-08-27-gh-pages-domain.png]({{site.baseurl}}/_drafts/2015-08-27-gh-pages-domain.png)


So I looked for the [best affordable](lifehacker.com/5943452/five-best-domain-name-registrars) [domain resgistrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar) and chose [namecheap](https://manage.www.namecheap.com/). I searched for "mbaharsyah" domain and it suggested quite a number of alternatives like "mbaharsyah.com", "mbaharsyah.net", etc... But inspired by a certain [company](https://abc.xyz/) I picked ["mbaharsyah.xyz"](http://mbaharsyah.xyz), and it was on sale for first year too!

After I got all these ingredients:
- Web Hosting (Github Pages)
- Domain Name (from namecheap)
- Tools (Jekyll, markdown, etc...)

I started to build the website up, and the next post will describe how I used all those ingredients in geeky language ;)
