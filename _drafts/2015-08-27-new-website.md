I had wanted to setup my own website for so long. The main reason was simply to make myself visible on the net. Other benefits include:
* Platform for blogging about this and that
* Showcase my works (I am a software engineer, btw)
* Share my knowledge on the stuff I like
* ...

I had been looking for some alternatives when I found [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). Github pages can host [static pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page). And for me that's enough as I would not need a web application. While reading its description, I noticed one very interesting feature: blog with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
